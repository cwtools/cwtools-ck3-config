### duel effect that selects an effect based on comparing specified skill of a character to a value or another character's skill. Alternatively, the compare value can be scripted completely duel = { 	skill = X 	target = Y 	value = Z 	localization = W ... random list body } Where X is the skill to compare, Y is the target character (requires skill to be set) or integer value Z (works with or without the skill), the rest of the effect is the same as random_list If the skill is unspecified, the effect needs a value Z (which can use scripted math) which it will then use as the duel vlue directly If localization = W is specified, the effect localization W will be used (entry in effect_localization database, not a localization key directly) The skill difference (or scripted duel value) is available as scope:duel_value inside the outcome entries, the duel target is accessible as scope:duel_target Valid skill, target, combinations: skill + target, skill + value, only value  Since there is now no automatic weighting, we should be using weight numbers in a comparable range to the scope:duel_value value. Since that will always be between -20 and 20 (unless you do something very unusual), and typically in a more narrow range than that, we should stick to those ranges.  Only use larger weights if you want the duel_value to have a smaller impact on the weighting, and only use smaller weights if you want the duel_value to have a huge impact on the weighting.  In addition, it is fully possible for the compare_modifier to reduce the weight to 0, which would mean that it will not be possible to happen at all. I've requested code support to make it so that we can define min and max values for weights, but until further notice we should use ranges that are guaranteed to not hit 0, or include min values in the compare_modifier itself.  Lastly, remember that if you want the outcome of a duel to scale linearly from (almost) 0% to (almost) 100%, the duel_value should be applied 50% to the good outcome, and -50% to the bad outcome. If you only apply it on one side, you will retain a (presumably significant) chunk of chance for the other outcome.
